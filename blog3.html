       I completed my schooling in Kerala and later pursued a BSc in Computer Science, where I gained strong exposure to programming languages, computer hardware, networking, and core technical concepts. During my graduation, my college conducted several workshops and seminars on emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Data Science, and Cyber Security.
These sessions helped me understand an important reality of the modern world—technology is a key driver of scalable business growth. Businesses were not just using technology for operations, but also to reach customers, build brands, and expand faster.
Through these seminars, I was introduced to concepts like digital marketing and how businesses use online platforms to promote products and services. This sparked my curiosity, and I began researching digital marketing independently. I found the field exciting because it combined technology, creativity, data, and business strategy.
During the final semester of my graduation, I worked on a project where my team developed a tuition app along with a supporting website. Once the project was completed, a new question came to my mind:
How do we launch this product into the market? How do we reach users and promote it effectively?
That’s when I connected the dots between my technical background and digital marketing. I realized that building a product is only half the journey—marketing determines its success.
After graduation, I enrolled in a 4-month Search Engine Marketing Executive course at a skill development center under the National Skill Development Council of India (NSDC). During this program, I learned core digital marketing skills such as keyword research, pay-per-click (PPC) campaign setup, campaign tracking, performance analysis, and reporting.
Along with technical skills, the course also focused on communication skills, basic graphic designing, and employability skills, which helped me develop a more professional mindset.
Wanting to explore digital marketing further, I joined a 2-month Digital Marketing course at Techoriz Digital Academy. This program gave me hands-on exposure to multiple areas including SEO, Social Media Marketing (Meta Ads), Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and WordPress-based web development. This experience helped me understand how different digital channels work together to build brand visibility and generate leads.
To strengthen my communication and presentation skills, I later joined Anglo Academy for an English communication course, which significantly improved my confidence in professional and client-facing environments.
As my interest grew beyond execution into strategy, branding, and business decision-making, I decided to pursue higher education in management. I enrolled in MBA Marketing at Parul University, Gujarat. I intentionally chose Gujarat because it is widely known for its business culture and entrepreneurial exposure. Studying in a multi-state environment also helped me improve my Hindi communication skills through daily interaction with students from across India.
Through my MBA, I gained deeper expertise in branding, marketing strategy, consumer behavior, and business management, which complemented my technical and digital marketing background.
Today, my journey reflects a strong blend of technology, digital marketing, communication, and business strategy. I aim to leverage this multidisciplinary skill set to create meaningful marketing solutions that drive growth and brand value in the digital era.
